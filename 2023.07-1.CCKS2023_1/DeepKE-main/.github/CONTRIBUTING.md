# Contributing    
Welcome to the Deepke community! We're building relation extraction toolkits for research.   

## Simple Internal Code    
It's useful for users to look at the code and understand very quickly what's happening. Many users won't be engineers. Thus we need to value clear, simple code over condensed ninja moves. While that's super cool, this isn't the project for that :)
