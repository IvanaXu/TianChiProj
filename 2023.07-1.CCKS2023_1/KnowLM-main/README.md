# Knowledgable Large Language Model Framework.

With the rapid development of deep learning technology, large language models such as ChatGPT have made substantial strides in the realm of natural language processing. However, these expansive models still encounter several challenges in acquiring and comprehending knowledge, including the difficulty of updating knowledge and potential knowledge discrepancies and biases, collectively known as **knowledge fallacies**. The KnowLM project endeavors to tackle these issues by launching an open-source large-scale knowledgable language model framework and releasing corresponding models. 

The project's `initial phase` introduced a knowledge extraction LLM based on LLaMA, dubbed **ZhiXi** (**智析**, which means intelligent analysis of data for knowledge extraction). To integrate the capacity of Chinese understanding into the language models without compromising their inherent knowledge, we firstly <b>(1) use Chinese corpora for the full-scale pre-training with LLaMA (13B), augment the language model's understanding of Chinese and improve its knowledge richness while retaining its original English and code capacities;</b> Then <b>(2) we fine-tune the model obtained from the first step with an instruction dataset, thus bolstering the language model's understanding of human instructions for knowledge extraction.</b>
- ❗Please note that this project is still undergoing optimization, and the model weights will be regularly updated to support new features and models!

**The features of this project are as follows:**

- Centered on knowledge and large models, a **full-scale pre-training** of the large model, such as LLaMA, is conducted using the built Chinese&English pre-training corpus.
- Based on the technology of **KG2Instructions**, the knowledge extraction tasks, including NER, RE, and IE, are optimized and can be completed using human instructions.
- Using the built Chinese instruction dataset (approximately 1400K), LoRA fine-tuning is used to enhance the model's understanding of human instructions.
- The weights of the pre-training model and LoRA's instruction fine-tuning are open-sourced.
- The **full-scale pre-training code** (providing conversion, construction, and loading of large corpora) and **LoRA instruction fine-tuning code** are open-sourced (support multi-machine multi-GPU).


All weights have been uploaded to HuggingFace🤗. It should be noted that all the following effects are based on `ZhiXi-13B-Diff`. If you have downloaded `ZhiXi-13B-Diff-fp16`, there may be some variations in the effects.

## NEWS
- \[**July 2023**\] Support instruction fine-tuning and vllm for `LLaMA-2`
- \[**June 2023**\] The project name has been changed from `CaMA` to `KnowLM`.
- \[**June 2023**\] Release the first version of pre-trained weights and the LoRA weights.

## Why it's called ZhiXi (智析)?
In Chinese, "Zhi" (智) signifies intelligence, referencing the AI's advanced language understanding capabilities. "Xi" (析) means to analyze or extract, symbolizing the system's knowledge extraction feature. Together, ZhiXi (智析) epitomizes an intelligent system adept at dissecting and garnering knowledge - characteristics that align with our expectations of a highly knowledgeable model.

  \# THE MAGIC UNICORN CORPORATION

  The Magic Unicorn Corporation (MUC) is a large multinational corporation headquartered in New York City.  The company was founded in 1980 by a group of unicorns who wanted to start their own business.  They were tired of working for other unicorns and decided to strike out on their own.  Their first product was a line of unicorn-themed greeting cards.  The cards were a huge success, and the company grew rapidly.  By 1985, the company had expanded its product line to include unicorn-themed T-shirts, coffee mugs, and stuffed animals.  In 1987, the company went public.  Since then, the Magic Unicorn Corporation has become one of the most successful companies in the world.<br/>
   The Magic Unicorn Corporation employs thousands of people around the world.  Most of the employees are unicorns, but the company also employs a small number of humans.  Humans are hired to do jobs that unicorns cannot or will not do.  For example, humans are hired to clean up after unicorns.  Humans are also hired to feed the unicorns:eight_spoked_asterisk:

  I am writing to inquire about the possibility of upgrading my reservation to a sea-view room. I have booked a standard room for my upcoming stay, but I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to enjoy the breathtaking views of the ocean from my room.
  
  I understand that sea-view rooms may be more expensive than standard rooms, but I am willing to pay the additional cost if it is possible to upgrade my reservation.
  
  Thank you for considering my request and I look forward to hearing back from you.
  
  Sincerely,
  [Your Name]
  ```

<h2 id="2">2. Quick Start</h2>

> ❗❗❗ Note that in terms of hardware, performing step `2.2`, which involves merging LLaMA-13B with ZhiXI-13B-Diff, requires approximately **100GB** of RAM, with no demand for VRAM (this is due to the memory overhead caused by our merging strategy. For your convenience, we have provided the fp16 weights at this link: https://huggingface.co/zjunlp/zhixi-13b-diff-fp16. **fp16 weights require less memory but may slightly impact performance**. We will improve our merging approach in future updates, and we are currently developing a 7B model as well, so stay tuned). For step `2.4`, which involves inference using `ZhiXi`, a minimum of **26GB** of VRAM is required.

<h3 id="2-1">2.1 Environment Configuration</h3>

```shell
conda create -n zhixi python=3.9 -y
conda activate zhixi
pip install torch==1.13.1+cu116 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


<h3 id="2-2">2.2 Pretraining model weight acquisition and restoration</h3>

> Since the Meta has not fully released the weights of LLaMA, we have computed the difference between the ZhiXi weights and the LLaMA weights and uploaded them [here](https://huggingface.co/zjunlp/zhixi-13b-diff). To restore the complete ZhiXi weights, please follow the steps outlined below.

**1. Download LLaMA 13B and ZhiXi-13B-Diff**

Please click [here](https://forms.gle/jk851eBVbX1m5TAv5) to apply for the official pre-training weights of LLaMA from `meta`. In this case, we are using the `13B` version of the model, so you only need to download the `13B` version. Once downloaded, the file directory will be as follows:

```shell
|-- 13B
|	|-- checklist.chk
|	|-- consolidated.00.pth
|	|-- consolidated.01.pth
|	|-- params.json
|-- llama.sh
|-- tokenizer.model
|-- tokenizer_checklist.chk
```

You can use the following command to download the `ZhiXi-13B-Diff` file (assuming it is saved in the `./zhixi-diff` folder):
```shell
python tools/download.py --download_path ./zhixi-diff --only_base
```

If you want to download the diff weights in the fp16 format, please use the following command (assuming it is saved in the `./zhixi-diff-fp16` folder):
```shell
python tools/download.py --download_path ./zhixi-diff-fp16 --only_base --fp16
```

> :exclamation:Noted. If the download is interrupted, please repeat the command mentioned above. HuggingFace provides the functionality of resumable downloads, allowing you to resume the download from where it was interrupted.

**2. Use the conversion script provided by huggingface**

To convert the original LLaMA-13B model into the HuggingFace format, you can use the provided script file by HuggingFace, which can be found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py). Below is the command to run the script (assuming the downloaded original files(LLaMA-13B) are located in `./` and you want the converted files to be stored in `./converted`):

```shell
python convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py --input_dir ./ --model_size 13B --output_dir ./converted
```

**3. Restore ZhiXi 13B**

Use the script we provided, located at `./tools/weight_diff.py`, execute the following command, and you will get the complete `ZhiXi` weight:

```shell
python tools/weight_diff.py recover --path_raw ./converted --path_diff ./zhixi-diff --path_tuned ./zhixi
```

The final complete ZhiXi weights are saved in the `./zhixi` folder.

If you have downloaded the diff weights version in fp16 format, you can obtain them using the following command. Please note that there might be slight differences compared to the weights obtained in fp32 format:
```shell
python tools/weight_diff.py recover --path_raw ./converted --path_diff ./zhixi-diff-fp16 --path_tuned ./zhixi
```

> ❗NOTE. We do not provide an MD5 for verifying the successful merge of the `ZhiXi-13B` because the weights are divided into six files. We employ the same validation strategy as [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca), which involves performing a sum check on the weights (you can refer to this [link](https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowLLM/blob/main/tools/weight_diff.py#L108)). **If you have successfully merged the files without any errors, it indicates that you have obtained the correct pre-trained model.**


<h3 id="2-3">2.3 Instruction tuning LoRA weight acquisition</h3>

Use the script file we provided, located at `./tools/download.py`, execute the following command to get the LoRA weight (assuming the saved path is located at `./lora`):

```shell
python tools/download.py --download_path ./lora --only_lora
```

The final complete weights are saved in the `./lora` folder.



<h3 id="2-4">2.4 Model Usage Guide</h3>

**1. Reproduce the results in Section 1**

> The cases in `Section 1` were all run on V100. If running on other devices, the results may vary. Please run multiple times or change the decoding parameters.

1. If you want to reproduce the results in section `1.1`(**pretraining cases**), please run the following command (assuming that the complete pre-training weights of `ZhiXi` have been obtained according to the steps in section `2.2`, and the ZhiXi weight is saved in the `./zhixi` folder):

   ```shell
   python examples/generate_finetune.py --base_model ./zhixi
   ```

   The result in section `1.1` can be obtained.

2. If you want to reproduce the results in section `1.2`(**information extraction cases**), please run the following command (assuming that the LoRA weights of `ZhiXi` have been obtained according to the steps in section `2.3`, and the LoRA weights is saved in the `./lora` folder):

   ```shell
   python examples/generate_lora.py --load_8bit --base_model ./zhixi --lora_weights ./lora --run_ie_cases
   ```

   The result in section `1.2` can be obtained.

3. If you want to reproduce the results in section `1.3`(**general ablities cases**), please run the following command (assuming that the LoRA weights of `ZhiXi` have been obtained according to the steps in section `2.3`, and the LoRA weights is saved in the `./lora` folder):

   ```shell
   python examples/generate_lora.py --load_8bit --base_model ./zhixi --lora_weights ./lora --run_general_cases
   ```

   The result in section `1.3` can be obtained.



**2. Usage of Pretraining Model**

We offer two methods: the first one is **command-line interaction**, and the second one is **web-based interaction**, which provides greater flexibility.

1. Use the following command to enter **command-line interaction**:

   ```shell
   python examples/generate_finetune.py --base_model ./zhixi --interactive
   ```

   The disadvantage is the inability to dynamically change decoding parameters.

2. Use the following command to enter **web-based interaction**:

   ```shell
   python examples/generate_finetune_web.py --base_model ./zhixi
   ```
   Here is a screenshot of the web-based interaction:
   <p align="center" width="100%">
   <a href="" target="_blank"><img src="./assets/finetune_web.jpg" alt="finetune-web" style="width: 100%; min-width: 100px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>
   </p>

**3. Usage of Instruction tuning Model**

Here, we provide a web-based interaction method. Use the following command to access the web:

```shell
python examples/generate_lora_web.py --base_model ./zhixi --lora_weights ./lora
```

Here is a screenshot of the web-based interaction:
<p align="center" width="100%">
<a href="" target="_blank"><img src="./assets/lora_web.png" alt="finetune-web" style="width: 100%; min-width: 100px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>
</p>

The `instruction` is a required parameter, while `input` is an optional parameter. For general tasks (such as the examples provided in section `1.3`), you can directly enter the input in the `instruction` field. For information extraction tasks (as shown in the example in section `1.2`), please enter the instruction in the `instruction` field and the sentence to be extracted in the `input` field. We provide an information extraction prompt in section `2.5`. 

If you want to perform batch testing, please modify the `examples/generate_lora.py` file and update the examples and hyperparameters in the variable `cases`.

According to different task requirements, we have the following suggestions for adjusting decoding strategies and their associated hyperparameters:

1. If you want more diverse and creative outputs, consider using top-k or top-p (nucleus) sampling with a relatively higher `top_k` or `top_p`, and possibly a higher `temperature`.
2. If you want more focused and high-quality outputs (e.g., information extraction), consider using beam search with a moderate `num_beam`, or top-k or top-p sampling with a lower `top_k` or `top_p`, and a lower `temperature`.
3. Remember to experiment and fine-tune. Depending on your use case, it may be beneficial to iterate and experiment with different strategies and hyperparameters to find the optimal combination.

**4. vLLM API server**

We interagte [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) for accelerating LLM inference and providing efficient API service. Use the following command to launch vLLM API server at `http://localhost:8090`.

```shell
max_num_batched_tokens=8000

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2 python inference/launch_vllm.py \
    --port 8090 \
    --model data/zhixi-13B \
    --use-np-weights \
    --max-num-batched-tokens $max_num_batched_tokens \
    --dtype half \
    --tensor-parallel-size 2
```

Query the service using POST request:

```shell
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8090/generate" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"instruction": "你好", "input": "", "parameters": {"top_p": 0.7, "max_tokens": 256}}'
```

You could get the following response:

```shell
{
  "generated_text":"你好，很高兴见到你。我是一个人工智能助手，可以帮助你解决问题和提供信息。有什么我可以帮助你的吗？</s>",
  "num_output_tokens_cf":65,
  "error":null
}
```

<h3 id="2-5">2.5 Information Extraction Prompt</h3>

For information extraction tasks such as named entity recognition (NER), event extraction (EE), and relation extraction (RE), we provide some prompts for ease of use. You can refer to this [link](./examples/ie_prompt.py) for examples. Of course, you can also try using your own prompts.

Here is a [case](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/example/llm/InstructKGC/README.md) where ZhiXi-13B-LoRA is used to accomplish the instruction-based knowledge graph construction task in CCKS2023.

<h3 id="2-6">2.6 Combining ZhiXi-13B-LoRA Weights with ZhiXi-13B Weights</h3>

If you wish to merge `ZhiXi-13B-LoRA` with `ZhiXi-13B`, you can use the following command for merging, and the output model weights will be saved in the "./zhixi-sft" folder:
```shell
python weight_diff.py merge --path_zhixi ./zhixi --path_lora ./zhixi-lora --path_sfted ./zhixi-sft
```

<h2 id="3">3. Training Details</h2>

> The following figures illustrates the entire training process and dataset construction. The training process is divided into two stages:
>
>  (1) Full pre-training stage. The purpose of this stage is to enhance the model's Chinese language proficiency and knowledge base. 
>
>  (2) Instruction tuning stage using LoRA. This stage enables the model to understand human instructions and generate appropriate responses.

<h3 id="3-1">3.1 Dataset Construction (Pretraining)</h3>

In order to enhance the model's understanding of Chinese while preserving its original code and English language capabilities, we did not expand the vocabulary. Instead, we collected Chinese corpora, English corpora, and code corpora. The Chinese corpora were sourced from Baidu Baike, Wudao, and Chinese Wikipedia. The English dataset was sampled from the original English corpus of [LLaMA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971.pdf), with the exception of the Wikipedia data. The original paper's English Wikipedia data was up until August 2022, and **we additionally crawled data from September 2022 to February 2023, covering a total of six months.** As for the code dataset, due to the low-quality code in the `Pile` dataset, we crawled code data from GitHub and LeetCode. A portion of the data was used for pre-training, while another portion was used for fine-tuning with instructions.

For the crawled datasets mentioned above, we employed a heuristic approach to filter out harmful content. Additionally, we removed duplicate data.

<h3 id="3-2">3.2 Training Process (Pretraining)</h3>

Detailed data processing code, training code, complete training scripts, and detailed training results can be found in [./pretrain](./pretrain).

Before training, we need to tokenize the data. We set the maximum length of a single sample to `1024`, while most documents are much longer than this. Therefore, we need to partition these documents. **We designed a greedy algorithm to split the documents, with the goal of ensuring that each sample consists of complete sentences and minimizing the number of segments while maximizing the length of each sample.** Additionally, due to the diversity of data sources, we developed a comprehensive data preprocessing tool that can process and merge data from various sources. Finally, considering the large amount of data, loading it directly into memory would impose excessive hardware pressure. Therefore, we referred to [DeepSpeed-Megatron](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/Megatron-DeepSpeed/tree/main/tools) and used the `mmap` method to process and load the data. This involves loading the indices into memory and accessing the corresponding data on disk when needed.

Finally, we performed pre-training on 5.5 million Chinese samples, 1.5 million English samples, and 0.9 million code samples. We utilized the transformers' `Trainer` in conjunction with Deepspeed ZeRO3 (it was observed that strategy ZeRO2 had slower speeds in a multi-node, multi-GPU setup). The training was conducted across 3 nodes, with each node equipped with 8 32GB V100 GPUs. The table below showcases our training speeds:

| Parameter                                         | Values         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| micro batch size                                  | 20             |
| gradient accumulation                             | 3              |
| global batch size                                 | 20\*3\*24=1440 |
| Time-consuming of a step                          | 260s           |



<h3 id="3-3">3.3 Dataset Construction (Instruction tuning)</h3>

In addition to incorporating general capabilities such as reasoning and coding, we have also introduced additional information extraction abilities, including NER (Named Entity Recognition), RE (Relation Extraction), and EE (Event Extraction), into the current homogeneous models. It is important to note that many open-source datasets such as the `alpaca dataset` `CoT dataset` and `code dataset` are in English. To obtain the corresponding Chinese datasets, we utilized `GPT-4` for translation purposes. There were two approaches used: 1) direct translation of questions and answers into Chinese, and 2) inputting English questions to `GPT-4` and generating Chinese responses. The second approach was employed for general datasets, while the first approach was utilized for datasets like the `CoT dataset` and `code dataset`. These datasets are readily available online.


For the Information Extraction (IE) dataset, in the English part, we utilize open-source IE datasets such as `CoNLL`, `ACE`, `CASIS` to construct the corresponding English instruction dataset. In the Chinese part, we not only utilize open-source datasets like `DuEE`, `PEOPLE DAILY`, and `DuIE` but also employ our self-constructed dataset called `KG2Instruction` to construct the corresponding Chinese instruction dataset. Specifically, KG2Instruction ([InstructIE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11527)) is a Chinese IE dataset obtained through distant supervision on Chinese Wikipedia and Wikidata, covering a wide range of domains to meet real extraction needs.


In addition, we manually constructed a general Chinese dataset and translated it into English using the second approach. Finally, our data distribution is as follows:

| Dataset           | Number |
| -------------------- | ---- |
| COT Datasets (Chinese, English)        |   202,333   |
| General Datasets (Chinese, English) |   105,216   |
| Code Datasets (Chinese, English) |   44,688   |
| Information Extraction Datasets (English)   |   537,429   |
| Information Extraction Datasets (Chinese)   |   486,768   |

</p>

<h3 id="3-4">3.4 Training Process (Instruction tuning)</h3>

Currently, most instruction tuning scripts using LoRA are based on [alpaca-lora](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/), so we will not go into detail here. Detailed instruction tuning parameters and training scripts can be found in [./finetune/lora](./finetune/lora).

 

<h2 id="4">4. Limitations</h2>

Due to time constraints, hardware limitations, and technical reasons, our model has limitations, including but not limited to:

- Our intruction tuning process does not involve full tuning. Instead, we use the LoRA approach for instruction tuning.
- Our model does not currently support multi-turn conversations.
- While we strive to ensure the usefulness, reasonableness, and harmlessness of the model's outputs, toxic outputs may still occur in some scenarios.

- The pretraining is not exhaustive. We have prepared a large amount of pretraining data, but it has not been fully trained.

- ······

  

<h2 id="5">5. TODO List</h2>

- Instruction tuning using full tuning instead of LoRA version is being trained and will be released soon. 
- New instruction tuning weights using LoRA will be updated shortly.
- New models (Llama-7b, Falcon-7b) are being trained (We have limited GPUs!).
- New abilities such as molecule and protein generation with [Mol-Instructions](https://github.com/zjunlp/Mol-Instructions), a large-scale biomolecules instruction dataset for large language models.
- supporting llama.cpp
- ......



<h2 id="6">6. FAQ</h2>

- Question: What should I do if the model encounters � during decoding?

  Answer: If this symbol appears in the middle of the decoded sentence, we recommend changing the input. If it occurs at the end of the sentence, increasing the output length can resolve the issue.

- Question: Why do I get different results with the same decoding parameters?

  Answer: It is possible that you have enabled `do_sample=True`. It could also be due to the order of execution. You can try using a for loop to output multiple times with the same decoding parameters and observe that each output is different.
  
- Question: Why is the extraction or answer quality not good?

  Answer: Please try changing the decoding parameters.
